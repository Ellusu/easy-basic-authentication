## Troubleshooting: Resetting Basic Authentication

If you're having trouble logging in due to the basic authentication, you can reset it and regain access by following these steps:

1 **Connect to your website via FTP.**
2 **Navigate to the plugin directory:**

   <pre>wp-content/plugins/easy-basic-authentication/class/</pre>

3 **Locate the file:**

   <pre>easy-basic-authentication-class.php</pre>

4 **Find the following line:**

   <pre>add_action( 'init', array($this,'basic_auth_admin') );</pre>

5 **Comment out that line** by adding a `#` at the beginning:

   <pre>#add_action( 'init', array($this,'basic_auth_admin') );</pre>

6 **Save the file** and re-upload it to your server.

This will disable the basic authentication temporarily, allowing you to log in. Once logged in, you can adjust the plugin settings as needed.
